# MAKING VIDEO SHOWING SETUP - Will be added with better instructions soon..
If this is your first time you will also have to install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/) to your computer. Then create a Datastore project, go to your IAM & Admin section, then on the left side of the tabs go to "Service accounts" find the project you made and click the 3 dots on the right side of that line and select "Create key" then select json.  This file you want to keep secure.  Make a duplicate of the google_api_service_key_EXAMPLE.json inside the [src](https://github.com/DaveyEdwards/react-starter-kit-relay-modern-GCP-Datastore/tree/master/src) folder and delete the underscore and EXAMPLE.json part (this file will is hidden from your pushes to Github inside your [.gitignore](https://github.com/DaveyEdwards/react-starter-kit-relay-modern-GCP-Datastore/blob/master/.gitignore) file)
